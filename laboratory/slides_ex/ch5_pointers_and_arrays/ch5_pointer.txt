Pointers 

- C provide two unary operators, '&' and '*' -->  for manipulating data using pointers.
    & = address operator 
    * = dereferencing(indirection) operator

    remark:
        # dereferenced pointer has new type, regardless of real type of data
        # can explicitly cast any pointer type to any other pointer type



- general pointer
    void *pointer;
    *pointer could point to any data type. i.e int, float or double 



- void swap(int *a, int *b){
        // swapping code
    }
    here we pass the address
    swap(&a, &b);



- function returning a pointer
    function can return a pointer
    Example -> int *myFunction(){......}
    but never return a pointer to local variable, unless it's def as static
