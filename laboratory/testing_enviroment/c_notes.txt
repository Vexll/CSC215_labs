- to execute a c file 
    compile first and then execute your target file 
    command: ./<file_name>



- to compile and see the errors
    command: gcc <file_name>.c -o <executable_file> -Wall
    good practice to name executable_file like your_file



- what does #include <header_file.h> means?
    include is a preprocessor, where it's read the content of the header file.



- function prototype = <return_type> <function_name>();
    function declaration:
        <return_type> <function_name>(<parameters>){
            //body
        }

    remark if a function has not given return_type, C will consider it as int


- Null in C = "\0"



- printf() function:
    specifiers (place holders):
        %d - int (same as %i)
        %ld - long int (same as %li)
        %f - decimal floating point
        %lf - double or long double
        %e - scientific notation (similar to %E)
        %c - char
        %s - string
        %o - signed octal
        %x - hexadecimal (similar to %X)
        %p - pointer
        %% - %




- scanf() function: to get the inputs from user:
    & = refer to address
        example
               int x;
               printf("enter a number");
               scanf("%d", &x);
               printf("your number is %d \n", x);
    
    same specifiers of printf function


- better way to get user input is to use fgets() function:
    fgets(<variable>, <size_of_variable>, stdin); --> stdin = standard input
    this method usually use to avoid white spaces




- Storage classes:
    storage classes: is a modifier precedes the variable to define its scope and lifetime.
        - auto: the default for local variable

        - register: advice to the compiler to store a local variable in a register
            # the advice is not necessarily taken by the compiler

        - static: tells the compiler that the storage of that variable remains in existence
            Local variable with static modifier remains in memory so that  can be accessed later
            Global variable with static modifier are limited to the file where they are declared

        - extern: points the identifier to a previously defined variable



- Main function in C has 2 forms

    1st(with parameters)

    2nd(without parameters)
